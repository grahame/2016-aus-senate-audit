# 2016-aus-senate-audit

This directory is to support work on auditing
the 2016 Australian Senate elections.

The work is joint with Vanessa Teague (U. Melbourne), Philip Stark (UC Berkeley),
Zara Perumal (MIT), Ian Gordon (U. Melbourne), Damjan Vukcevic, and
Ronald L. Rivest (MIT).

The approach explored here is to use ``black-box auditing'' methods
developed by Stark and Rivest (unpublished).  These are ballot-polling
methods (not comparison audits).

The work also uses methods developed by Rivest and Yu for computing
a ``variant sample'' of a set of ranked-choice ballots.

We further use python 
[code and materials](https://github.com/grahame/dividebatur)
developed by Grahame Bowland for computing the outcome of such
an election.

and 
[code and materials](https://github.com/berjc/election-engine)
developed by Berj K Chilingirian, Zara Perumal, and Eric C Huppert as a framework for election auditing

Requires python 3
